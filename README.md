# Template Application

This is a light-weight boilerplate application I've customized from scratch,
to allow me to pull the template and get to work on the important bits.

Feel free to use the code as you see fit, it's built using the lovely system,
Meteor.

## Getting Started

After downloading directory and navigating to the directory in your terminal,
type "meteor" to launch the application in your browser on localhost:3000.
